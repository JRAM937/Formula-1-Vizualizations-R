## Introduction
Description of data and problem(s) you are solving.  Include data source(s) here, either through citation or link to webpage.
>Question 1: Does fastestst driver in qualifying time #3 have the most wins in Abu Dhabi?
>Question 2: Which team had the most wins in 2021?

## Graphic 1
Provide a brief description of your goal with your created graphic and what it demonstrates
```{r}
#include code for any data manipulation and variable creation used to create teh graphic as well as the code for the graph creation - be sure to comment all code with description of steps being completed with each line of code
qualifying_times %>% 
  mutate(q3 = replace(q3, q3 == "\\N", "0.0")) %>% 
  filter(raceId == "17") %>% 
  select(driverId, q3) %>% 
  filter(q3 != "0.0") %>% 
  arrange(q3) %>% 
  write_csv("clean_times.csv")
```

```{r}
driver_standings %>% 
  filter(raceId == "17") %>% 
  mutate(label = driverId) %>% 
  write_csv("clean_drivers.csv") %>% 
  
ggplot(aes(x = driverId, y = wins)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = wins, x = driverId, y = wins)) +
  geom_text(aes(label=label)) +
  xlim(0, 25) 
```
> No, the driver who has the fastest Quaifying time #3 is not the one who has the most wins in the circuit Abu Dhabi.
